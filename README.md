# VMware s3 backup

This will enable you to fully backup incrementally an instance on the vmware vcenter/esxi to s3 directly, without any separate steps to convert and send it.

This repo is mostly stolen from [migratekit](https://github.com/vexxhost/migratekit) and I am trying to upgrade it to use S3 client. Because it will create so much change I have decided to make it to another repository.
